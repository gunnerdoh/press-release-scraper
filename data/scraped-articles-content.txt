    "content": "Globus Medical has won FDA clearance for its new ExcelsiusFlex orthopedics robot stereotaxic surgery in knee procedures and an expanded indication for its ExcelsiusHub system.Audubon, Pennsylvania-based Globus Medical received the 510(k) clearance on June 14 for the robotic positioning system, which was designed to help surgeons position implant components and prepare bony anatomy during orthopedic procedures.“We are ramping up production and targeting commercial release in the fourth quarter,” a Globus spokesperson told MassDevice today.“We are excited to have received 510(k) clearance by the FDA for ExcelsiusFlex with Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) application,” the spokesperson said in a email. “This new robotic navigation platform joins the already best-in-class Excelsius Ecosystem, designed to offer surgeons enhanced control, resection accuracy, and procedural flexibility to Total Knee Arthroplasty.”“ExcelsiusFlex is indicated to assist the surgeon in primary total knee arthroplasty procedures for guided resections based on implant placement planning,” she continued. “Multiple workflows and unrestricted jig-less resections restores control of the saw and the procedure to the surgeon. Streamlined user software enable efficient procedures.”In 2017, Globus Medical won FDA clearance for its Excelsius GPS robot-assisted surgery platform for spine. The company launched its Excelsius3D intraoperative, image-guided robotic navigation in 2022 for use with Excelsius GPS. Excelsius3D was designed for more accurate implant placement, less radiation exposure and shorter operative times.Related: 10 surgical robotics companies you need to knowGlobus Medical’s ExcelsiusFlex 510(k) summaryGlobus Medical used Excelsius GPS as the primary 510(k) predicate for ExcelsiusFlex, listing four other predicates: Globus Medical’s ExcelsiusHub and AQrate Robotic Assistance System, Stryker’s Mako Total Knee Application, and the Johnson & Johnson Medtech DePuy Synthes Velys Robotic-Assisted Solution.Globus Medical’s 510(k) summary describes ExcelsiusFlex as “a robotic positioning system with a computer controlled robotic arm, hardware and software that works in conjunction with ExcelsiusHub to enable real time surgical navigation and robotic guidance using patient tracking arrays and a positioning camera.”“The system assists the surgeon in implant placement planning and intraoperative tracking of patient anatomy by locating anatomical structures and stereotaxic positioning of surgical instruments relative to patient CT images or directly acquired anatomical structures,” the company continued in its filing. “The navigation and guidance system determines the registration or mapping between the virtual patient (points on the patient images) and the physical patient (corresponding points on the patient’s anatomy) or directly acquired anatomical structures. Once this registration is created, the software positions the robotic arm on a planned resection plane.”The ExcelsiusFlex system includes end effectors and instruments for patient tracking, patient attachment and navigation.The 510(k) clearance also expanded the previous indication for ExcelsiusHub to include  orthopedic device planning and identification through directly acquired anatomical structures.Globus Medical makes knee reconstruction implants under the similar Gen-Flex/GenFlex2 names. Globus Medical’s 510(k) summary materials say ExcelsiusFlex is compatible with the GENflex2 and the Actify total knee system.The Actify system is not yet listed on Globus Medical’s website, but the FDA gave it 510(k) clearance on June 20, classifying it as a cemented, semi-constrained, polymer/metal/polymer patellofemorotibial knee prosthesis.Globus robotic procedure growth acceleratesGlobus has said in recent months that the robot was on the way. In November, Globus President and CEO Dan Scavilla said the company planned to launch a knee robot in the first half of 2024.“With that comes, obviously, the cementless knee, which I think will be the major player there and that is well progressing on a good pace,” Scavilla said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript of the Q3 2023 earnings call. “I think 2024, we’ll start talking obviously more about the joints in total.”Last month, Scavilla said the company had filed for regulatory review of the robot.“We’re building inventory, getting ready to roll it out,” he said on the Q1 2024 earnings call, later describing the robot as “one of the most exciting things I think we’ll get out the door this year.”“The ortho robot coming out … will allow us to have more volume ramp-up of our implants of knees and hips,” Scavilla later continued. Procedures using Globus robots in Q1 grew 15% over the same quarter the year before, he said, pushing total robotic procedures past 71,000 since launch.Globus also expects an augmented reality headset to win FDA approval in the latter half of this year. “That’s one where we need to get that filed and approved through,” Scavilla said in May. “We feel good about it. We’re ready to do it, but it’s in queue right now just to get through our processes.”Globus is still working through its merger with NuVasive, laying off employees at the former NuVasive headquarters in San Diego earlier this year.This post was originally published on June 21, 2024, and updated on June 25 with the FDA clearance of Globus Medical’s Actify knee system."

    "timestamp": "June 20th, 2024",
    "content": "[Image courtesy of Meril]Meril this week unveiled its Misso surgical robot for simplifying orthopedic procedures.The India-based company announced on LinkedIn that it is developing a total knee surgical robot. It designed Misso to help surgeons with personalized pre-planning and precise cutting for joint replacement surgery.According to Meril, Misso has an optical tracking sensor, a six-axis articulated robotic arm and “superior” safety systems. The surgical robotic system helps physicians perform real-time gap checks and modify a surgical plan intraoperatively.Various cutting options are available on the Misso, including full and partial cutting based on surgeon preference. Cutting guides are not required and the system can perform a tibial cut and a fully finished femur with all the cuts, including peg holes.Meril designed Misso with bone movement monitoring to ensure safety during procedures. If bone movement is observed, the resection process stops. The resection will continue with automatic recovery of the bone position. If the robotic system’s tools contact the patient or other object, the collaborative robot arm will immediately stop moving.Misso uses optical tracking-based navigation and robotic assistance to ensure accurate results in shaping and aligning artificial knee joint components. The company aims to improve post-operative outcomes, reduce complications, and promote faster patient recovery.Meril joins the growing surgical robotics market and looks to compete with orthopedic surgical robot developers like Stryker and Zimmer Biomet. Stryker launched its next-gen Mako Total Knee surgical robotics platform in March 2023 after initially launching the total-knee platform in 2017. In February, Zimmer Biomet’s Rosa surgical robotic platform is cleared for shoulder and hip replacement procedures. The FDA also cleared it for partial knee replacement in April 2021."

    "timestamp": "June 12th, 2024",
    "content": "[Adobe Stock image]Our list of the largest orthopedic device companies has changed a lot since last year.A change in methodology means there is a new company at the top of this year’s MassDevice and Medical Design & Outsourcing ranking of the world’s largest orthopedic device companies. But mergers and spinoffs also added to the list two orthopedic developers and manufacturers that weren’t ranked last year.From endoscopic devices to brain surgery tech to emergency defibrillators, Stryker is so much more than an orthopedic device company. Our editors decided it was time to break out the company’s Orthopaedics and Spine business going forward. The move means that we now consider Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s DePuy Synthes business the world’s largest orthopedic device company, but just by a hair.Stryker could be back on the top next year. DePuy Synthes’ revenue growth accelerated to 4.4% in 2023, but Stryker’s ortho and spine business grew at an even faster rate of 10.5%.In fact, many of the companies on the largest orthopedic device companies list saw revenue growth pick up in 2023 as the industry returned to pre-pandemic growth levels.Stryker has especially enjoyed success on the popularity of its Mako surgical robotic systems for knee and hip surgeries. Last year, the Mako systems passed the 1 million procedure mark globally. Expect Mako’s growth to speed up even more, with shoulder and spine applications planned for later in 2024.Mako’s success means that many of Stryker’s competitors have also become more active in robotic and digital surgery.Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy Synthes recently secured FDA clearance for the use of its Velys surgical robot platform in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. The FDA previously cleared Velys for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in early 2021.Meanwhile, Zimmer Biomet recently agreed to distribute Think Surgical’s TMINI miniature robotic system for TKA, a move that provides a handheld robotic option on top of ZB’s flagship Rosa surgical robotics portfolio.And Smith+Nephew now has its CorioGraph pre-operative planning and modeling services for its Cori system.In addition to robotic surgery, consolidation left its mark on our largest orthopedic device companies list. NuVasive is now part of Globus Medical, and SeaSpine is part of Orthofix.Meanwhile, Alphatec’s 37% revenue growth in 2023 launched it ahead of ZimVie’s spine tech business, which ZimVie sold in April for $375 million to H.I.G. Capital. (The former ZimVie spine business is now called Highridge Medical.)Here are the world’s 10 largest orthopedic device companies, ranked by ortho business revenue pulled from their most recent annual reports:LARGEST ORTHOPEDIC DEVICE COMPANIESANNUAL REVENUE (% CHANGE)HEADQUARTERS OR SIGNIFICANT LOCATIONS1Johnson & Johnson (DePuy Synthes)$8.9B (+4.4%)Locations: Raynham, Massachusetts.; West Chester, Pennsylvania; Warsaw, Indiana; Palm Beach Gardens, Florida2Stryker (Orthopaedics and Spine)$8.7B (+10.5%)HQ: Kalamazoo, Michigan3Zimmer Biomet$7.4B (+6.5%)HQ: Warsaw, Indiana4Medtronic (Cranial & Spinal Technologies)$4.8B (+6.9%)Locations: Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Colorado5Smith+Nephew (Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine)$3.7B (+5.6%)HQ: London6Enovis$1.7B (+9.2%)HQ: Wilmington, Delaware7Globus Medical (merged with NuVasive) $1.6B *HQ: Audubon, Pennsylvania8Orthofix (merged with SeaSpine)$747M (+6.9%)HQ: Lewisville, Texas9Conmed (Orthopedic Surgery) $533M (+15.5%)HQ: Largo, Florida10 Alphatec$482M (+37%)HQ: Carlsbad, California* Revenue growth is unclear in Globus Medical’s annual report.Watch out for more Medtech Big 100 data posting in the late summer on our sibling site Medical Design & Outsourcing.Here are our 2023 rankings of the largest orthopedic device companies and our 2022 rankings."

    "title": "Zimmer Biomet, Think Surgical enter handheld surgical robot distribution deal",
    "timestamp": "June 11th, 2024",
    "content": "Zimmer Biomet          announced today that it entered into a limited distribution agreement with Think Surgical.The deal centers around Think’s wireless, handheld TMINI miniature robotic system for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). TMINI, which received FDA clearance in May 2023, features a wireless, robotic handpiece. It assists surgeons in performing total knee replacement.Following a CT-based three-dimensional surgical plan, the TMINI robotic handpiece automatically compensates for the surgeon’s hand movement to locate bone pins along precisely defined planes. Cutting guides are then connected to the bone pins for accurate bone resection.The distribution agreement results in an exclusive offering, integrating Zimmer Biomet technology into a customized TMINI solution. Zimmer Biomet said in a news release that TMINI complements its flagship Rosa surgical robot portfolio with a handheld robotic option. Rosa, which recently expanded into shoulder replacement, has four applications, including the knee. The company says it enables accurate implant placement to a predetermined, CT-based, 3D surgical plan.Dr. Nitin Goyal, Zimmer Biomet’s chief science, technology and innovation officer, says the deal makes the company the first to offer two complementary robotic systems for surgeons looking to incorporate robotic assistance while performing a knee replacement. The company plans to introduce the customized TMINI system in select U.S. markets in the second half of 2024.“TMINI addresses surgeon demand for an ergonomic, wireless, handheld robotic system and now, in addition to Rosa, underscores our dedication to empowering surgeons with more choices to make the right decision for each patient,” Goyal said. “Our strategic partnership with Think Surgical allows us to explore the value of a handheld platform to accelerate adoption of robotics in orthopedic surgery.“We believe the TMINI system’s design is particularly valuable and well-suited for knee procedures performed in ambulatory surgery centers and other out-patient settings.”The analysts’ view on the deal between Zimmer Biomet and Think SurgicalTruist analysts Richard Newitter, Samuel Brodovsky, Ravi Misra and Benjamin Goldstein shared their thoughts on the distribution agreement:“For [Zimmer Biomet], we view this as a complimentary solution that is consistent with the company’s strategy to grow into the rapidly expanding orthopedic ASC/outpatient site of care and enhance [Zimmer Biomet’s] competitive position within this portion of the market,” the analysts wrote.They say company management singled out ASCs and outpatient orthopedic procedures as a key growth and focus area last month. According to the analysts, the deal with Think provides another user-friendly offering in its portfolio. It should allow the company to compete with ASC-focused physicians who may have eyes on Stryker’s Mako robotic system.Currently, Think Surgical has 10 other implant partners working with TMINI. However, the analysts highlighted the customization aspect of Zimmer Biomet’s deal with Think.“Our thinking is that the TMINI/ZBH solution will be customized not only for ZBH’s implant portfolio (i.e. Persona), but may also integrate other aspects of ZBH’s growing digital ecosystem and workflows,” the analysts said.According to the Truist team, TMINI costs around $500,000. That lands at nearly half the cost of competitive robotic systems, although they note the possibility of a different business model for the Zimmer Biomet version.The analysts say that, despite no disclosed financial terms, they wouldn’t be surprised if Think structured participation from recurring implant revenue in some way. They suspect a potential revenue/profit sharing agreement within the relationship between companies."

    "timestamp": "June 3rd, 2024",
    "content": "Stryker          today announced it entered a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Artelon.Artelon specializes in soft tissue fixation for foot and ankle and sports medicine procedures. The acquisition is slated to strengthen Stryker’s offerings in the soft tissue fixation segment for ligament and tendon reconstruction.Artelon designed its technology to enhance biological and mechanical ligament and tendon reconstruction. It has been used in over 60,000 implantations worldwide, according to the company.“Artelon’s proven product portfolio and differentiated offerings will enhance our ability to innovate and serve our customers,” Tim Lanier, president of Stryker’s Trauma and Extremities division, said in a news release. “The addition of Artelon’s products to our already robust foot and ankle and sports medicine product portfolios will fuel our goal of establishing comprehensive offerings for customers in these segments. We share a common dedication to integrity, quality, and advancing the knowledge of healthcare providers to achieve the best clinical outcomes and rebuild patients’ lives.”The financial details of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Stryker and Artelon will continue operating as separate entities and proceed with business as usual until the transaction closes.More about Artelon’s technologyThe FlexBand Twist, FlexBand Solo, FlexBand Multi, and FlexBand Fix systems give orthopedic surgeons complete sets of tools and implants in a single-use, sterile blister. Each system targets specific indications.Twist is the company’s first soft tissue fixation system. It has a twist-in anchor locking and a Mod cube for intraoperative adaptability. Artelon designed Twist as a non-inflammatory matrix that can be quickly integrated with regenerating connective tissue. The quick integration allows the FlexBand technology to share in tensile loading, protecting the healing construct and driving the mechanical stimulation required for tissue regeneration and remodeling. According to the company, the FlexBand matrix is replaced by “highly organized” type-1 collagen over 4-6 years.Artelon’s Solo is a procedure kit with tap-in fixation for single ligament augmentation. The company designed the kit to reinforce a connective tissue repair or reconstruction. It helps simplify the tensioning step by offering the ability to auto-tension reinforce, the company says.Multi is a comprehensive procedure kit with tap-in fixation for multiple ligament augmentation. It helps re-tension, reinforce and biologically restore multiple ligament structures with one system. It offers 24 cm of FlexBand technology for more complex reconstructions.Fix is a scaled-down procedure kit with tap-in fixation for single ligament augmentation. It contains a 0.5 cm by 8 cm FlexBand and two anchors. According to Artelon, the smaller profile allows for a more streamlined system with “right-sized” instrumentation for augmenting soft tissues in the extremities.In May 2023, Artelon raised $20 million in a Series B funding round for its joint instability treatment. The company planned to use the proceeds to fund commercial growth and clinical research while developing its proprietary Dynamic Matrix technology for musculoskeletal soft tissue reconstruction."

    "content": "The Mako robotic-assisted surgery system. [Image courtesy of Stryker]Stryker          recently initiated a voluntary correction for application software in the Mako total knee system.The company issued the urgent field safety notice due to increased software error #3 codes when a Mako system shutdown or restart is not performed before switching between total knee and total hip applications.If the Mako system generates the software error, Stryker said there could be a loss or deterioration of robotic system function and delays in surgery to exit and reenter the application page, restart the Mako Arm software, obtain a replacement Mako robotic system or convert to manual surgery.The company also said the potential harms are complications associated with extended surgery.Stryker’s mitigationStryker said that a Mako system shutdown or restart prior to launching another application eliminates the occurrence of the software error. Restarting the Mako Arm software before the start of a case or after the occurrence of software error #3 also reduces the hazards and harms.The company recommends that healthcare providers use the risk mitigation steps to prevent software error #3 or to clear software error #3 if it is generated by the Mako robotic system. It also requests that healthcare providers return customer response forms to acknowledge the mitigation.The Mako system has been an important driver of Stryker’s growth in knee and hip replacement tech, with over 1 million procedures performed in more than 40 countries. Needham analysts recently upgraded their rating of SYK shares from “Neutral” to “Buy” ahead of the launch of Mako shoulder and spine applications expected this year."

    "content": "The Hugo robotic surgery system [Image from Medtronic]Medtronic          is initiating additional clinical studies of its Hugo robotic-assisted surgery system to expand its indications to hernia and gynecology.The company said the studies are underway to support a planned submission to the FDA for the Hugo RAS system. Medtronic is now pursuing three indications for Hugo as it builds on momentum outside the U.S., with install bases growing across 25 countries and over 100 independent scientific publications globally.“[It’s] critical that we are now operating across multiple indications, so that as we come into the market, we can have a series of launches across each of those to capture larger and larger pieces of the market. And we’re seeing good execution, early execution inside of each of those studies as well,” Mike Marinaro, EVP of Medtronic’s Medical Surgical portfolio, said during the company’s Q4 earnings call today. (Overall, Medtronic officials spoke of durable revenue growth and accelerated earnings growth.)The Enable Hernia Repair U.S. clinical trial began with a robotic-assisted bilateral inguinal hernia repair procedure at Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C., performed by Dr. Jacob Greenberg, the trial’s national principal investigator.The clinical trial is a prospective, multicenter study evaluating the safety and performance of Hugo RAS in support of an FDA submission. Medtronic’s Expand URO clinical trial for urologic procedures is nearly completed.“Our team is committed to exploring new technologies to advance care for patients,” Greenberg said in a news release. “This clinical trial aims to evaluate a new robotic-assisted surgery system in offering a precise and minimally invasive option for this painful condition, which affects millions of Americans every year.”Medtronic also initiated a prospective clinical study for gynecologic procedures to support a planned submission to the FDA.“Medtronic is committed to providing safe and effective healthcare technology that helps clinicians advance patient care,” said Eric Vang, VP of clinical research and medical science in the Surgical business in the Medical Surgical portfolio at Medtronic. ” Hugo builds on that commitment as we combine the power and potential of people and technology to drive healthcare forward for all.”The Hugo RAS system is not cleared or approved in all markets. In the U.S., the Hugo RAS system is an investigational device and not for sale.Hugo looks to join one of the largest medtech marketsAccording to Medtronic, robotic-assisted procedures could give patients fewer complications, shorter hospital stays and faster returns to normal activities.Through collaboration with surgeons and hospitals, Medtronic designed Hugo RAS to expand access to minimally invasive care to more patients worldwide.Hugo is a modular, multi-quadrant platform designed for various surgical procedures with wristed instruments, 3D visualization and surgical video capture options in Touch Surgery Enterprise.The company first unveiled Hugo in September 2019, and investors were eager to see it. At the time, SVB Leerink analysts said Medtronic’s entry into the soft tissue robot-assisted surgery space represented a significant growth opportunity for Medtronic — as well as Intuitive Surgical, which presently dominates soft-tissue robotic surgery — because it represented an expanding market.Several medtech companies have also entered the surgical robotics market in recent years, looking to compete with Intuitive. Intuitive has held the top surgical robot position for more than two decades and shows no signs of slowing down—it even won FDA clearance for its next-generation da Vinci 5 mulitport surgical robotics system in March.In the orthopedics space, Stryker has its Mako surgical robot for hip and knee replacements, and it plans to expand into shoulder and spine applications. Zimmer Biomet launched its own orthopedic surgical robot, ROSA, for total knee replacement.Surgical robotics for soft tissue applications and endoscopic procedures are also rising. In 2019, Johnson & Johnson MedTech acquired Auris Health and its surgical robot for bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Cases for CMR Surgical’s Versius robotic system span over 130 complex and benign procedure types as the British company expands outside the United States. Versius performs colectomies, hernia repairs, hysterectomies, sacrocolpopexies, and lobectomies across seven surgical specialties.Many other medtech companies, such as Moon Surgical, SS Innovations, Noah Medical, Corin Group, and others, are developing surgical robots.

    "content": "Stryker’s next-gen LifePak 35 [LinkedIn marketing image, background cropped and edited to fit]Stryker          this past week previewed a next-generation monitor/defibrillator after picking up a supplemental FDA approval.According to BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman, the orthopedic giant previewed the system at the Fire Department Instructors Conference (FDIC) in Indianapolis. The new LifePak 35 system received U.S.-only FDA clearance via a premarket approval (PMA) supplement on April 12. Zimmerman said the system builds on the previous version, the now-15-year-old LifePak 15.Stryker is yet to formally announce the rollout, but Zimmerman reported that management has been discussing launch plans. Zimmerman and BTIG’s Iseult McMahon received early feedback from EMS and firefighters based on discussions online, though.LifePak 35 isn’t an on-the-wall system and is geared toward higher-end acute care professionals. The analysts say that means EMS, firefighters, hospitals and more. It also carries a price point twice as high as the previous generation. Zimmerman and McMahon expect the technology to begin contributing in the second half of this year.According to BTIG, LifePak 35 has touch screens, data manipulation and connectivity across a number of devices within the care continuum. The analysts expect WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity and a weight reduction of about 2-3 pounds. This should help EMS professionals in terms of transporting between patients and carrying the devices.Software enhancements should help aid in CPR administration, enhanced battery life and other communication features, too.Zimmerman and McMahon maintained their “Buy” rating for Stryker."

    "title": "10 new, innovative medical devices to watch for in 2024",
    "timestamp": "April 18th, 2024",
    "content": "Clockwise from top left: Boston Scientific’s Farapulse, Zimmer Biomet’s Rosa, Edwards Lifesciences’ Evoque, Medtronic’s Affera, Dexcom’s G7 and Stryker’s Mako [Images courtesy of the companies]By Senior Editor Danielle Kirsh and Associate Editor Sean WhooleySignificant medical device launches are coming in 2024. Think pulsed field ablation, diabetes treatment tech, surgical robotics and more.Pulsed field ablation news took over at the end of 2023 and the start of 2024, with Medtronic and Boston Scientific garnering significant regulatory approvals. Surgical robotics remains a hot space, and some of the orthopedic giants are continuing to make waves there. Plus, heart valves, neurostimulation components, drug-coated balloons, and more are likely to hit the market sometime this year.This year is just the beginning, too. In coming years, expect the rollout of even more innovative medtech, including the full launch of Intuitive’s next-gen da Vinci 5 robotic surgery system.Here’s a list of 10 significant medical device launches we could see in 2024.Part of the Farapulse pulsed-field ablation system, the Farawave single-shot catheter is designed to create durable and circumferential lesions.

[Image from Boston Scientific]Click the ‘+’ symbol to expand.Boston Scientific | Pulsed field ablationDevice: FarapulseLaunch timeframe: Estimated to launch in the second half of 2024Farapulse’s nonthermal treatment uses electric fields to selectively ablate heart tissue. Boston Scientific bought Farapulse for nearly $300 million in 2021. The system delivers pulsed field energy with the Farawave ablation catheter, Farastar ablation generator and Faradrive steerable sheath. Boston Scientific’s VersaCross Connect access solution complements the sheath to provide safe and effective left heart access. The Farawave catheter treats a range of pulmonary vein anatomies using an over-the-wire catheter with a variable basket and flower shapes. This allows for the device to adapt to individual patient anatomies. Boston Scientific won FDA approval for Farapulse in January.Edwards Lifesciences | Tricuspid replacementDevice: Evoque TricuspidLaunch timeframe: Estimated mid-2024Edwards Lifesciences designed Evoque for tricuspid regurgitation. It won FDA approval in February, making it the first transcatheter therapy to receive an FDA nod to treat tricuspid regurgitation. Evoque features a nitinol self-expanding frame, intra-annular skirt and tissue leaflets made from bovine pericardial tissue. Edwards intends to offer the valve in three sizes, all delivered through the same low-profile transfemoral 28F system.Medtronic | Pulsed field ablationDevice: Affera PFALaunch timeframe: Estimated second half of fiscal 2024/First half of 2025Medtronic first made waves in the PFA space with its 2022 $1 billion acquisition of Affera and has since made significant progress in that space. Affera technology makes up a key component of Medtronic’s PulseSelect PFA system, which became the first such system FDA-cleared for treating AFib late last year. It also provides mapping and ablation within the Sphere-360 investigational PFA catheter technology.In January, CEO Geoff Martha reported “good progress” in bringing the Affera Sphere-9 PFA mapping and ablation catheter to market this year. The Affera system received CE mark more than a year ago.Dexcom | CGMsDevice: Non-insulin designed CGMLaunch timeframe: Likely second half of 2024Dexcom designed its Stelo CGM with a 15-day wear and a software experience tailored specifically for non-insulin users. At the company’s June Investor Day event, it revealed its plans to bring the new product to market in the U.S. in 2024. According to Dexcom, the target population includes approximately 70% of Americans with diabetes. The device won’t “bother” users with the alerts and alarms geared toward insulin users, Dexcom CEO Kevin Sayer told Drug Delivery Business News shortly after the company’s submission to the FDA. Rather, it just offers the insights that users desire. Stelo exists on the current G7 platform, so Sayer said manufacturing is already in place on the current lines the company has. Notably, rather than the initially touted cash-pay option, Stelo received FDA clearance as an over-the-counter offering in March.Device: 15-day G7Launch timeframe: Second half of 2024 or laterDexcom launched its next-generation G7 CGM more than a year ago. That device — the G7 — offers a 10-day wear time, but the company looks set for an upgrade from 10 days to 15 days. The extended-wear version of the leading CGM offering could be on the market some time this year.See the full list of diabetes devices set to launch in 2024.Stryker | Surgical robotic applicationsDevice: Mako spine/shoulderLaunch timeframe: Spine: Mid-2024/Shoulder: Second half of 2024Early last year, Stryker suggested that its Mako surgical robotic platform would have significant application expansions in 2024. It said it expected a Mako Spine launch in the second half of 2024, with Mako Shoulder out by the end of 2024. Mako Spine is an application that combines with the company’s new bone-cutting product. Then, Mako Shoulder will feature a robotic application that adds incremental precision. Stryker continues to expand Mako, unveling a new medium to extend a surgeon’s Mako SmartRobotics experience in and beyond the operating room earlier this year. The company’s myMako app for Apple Vision Pro and iPhone allows surgeons to visualize and review patients’ Mako surgical plans anytime, anywhere.Zimmer Biomet | New ROSA surgical robot applicationDevice: ROSA ShoulderLaunch timeframe: Mid-2024Zimmer Biomet won FDA clearance for its ROSA Shoulder robotic-assisted surgery system in February. The company designed ROSA Shoulder to allow surgeons to execute total shoulder replacement using anatomic or reverse techniques. It enables precise placement for improved outcomes. According to Zimmer Biomet, it’s one of the only systems that can reproduce humeral head resectioning and ease the insertion of instruments into incisions by requiring no pin in the center of the glenoid during procedures.Inari Medical | Arterial thrombectomyDevice: ArtixLaunch timeframe: Estimated 2024The Artix MT thrombectomy device is indicated for the non-surgical removal of emboli and thrombi from blood vessels. It can also be used for injection, infusion or aspiration of contrast media and other fluids into and from a blood vessel. The company designed it for use in the peripheral vasculature. Artix combines mechanical and aspiration thrombectomy and proximal flow arrest to prevent distal embolization. The sheath has four times the flow rate versus existing arterial catheters, according to the company.Inspire Medical | Next generation IPGDevice: Inspire VLaunch timeframe: Limited market release: Estimated second half of 2024; Full market release: Estimated first half of 2025Implantable pulse generators (IPGs) deliver low-intensity electrical impulses to nerve structures, allowing neurostimulation technologies to deliver therapeutic value. A next-generation IPG with a removed sensing lead could enhance the therapy delivered by Inspire Medical’s minimally invasive implantable products for treating obstructive sleep apnea. The devices offer an alternative to the traditional CPAP machines made by the likes of Philips and ResMed. Inspire Medical’s reputation has grown over the past several years as Philips dealt with a massive CPAP recall and people moved away from that method of treatment.Boston Scientific | Drug-coated balloonDevice: AgentLaunch timeframe: Estimated second half of 2024The FDA approved Boston Scientific’s Agent drug coated balloon in March. The DCB won approval for treating coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) in patients with coronary artery disease. ISR occurs when plaque or scar tissue obstructs or narrows a stented vessel. Boston Scientific said it plans to launch the device in the coming months. Agent serves as an alternative to traditional therapies like balloon angioplasty, additional layers of stenting or radiation. The paclitaxel-coated balloon transfers a therapeutic dose of the drug to the vessel wall, helping to prevent ISR reoccurrence.Alcon | Reusable lensDevice: Precision7Launch timeframe: Estimated 2024Alcon is set to launch its Precision7 reusable lens for seven-day wear. The lens is intended to correct vision by focusing light on the back of the eye, allowing the person wearing it to see a clear image. The company also designed the lens to treat near-sightedness (myopia), far-sightedness (hyperopia) and blurred or distorted vision due to an irregular curvature of the cornea, or front surface of the eye (astigmatism). These lenses also correct presbyopia that leads to a gradual inability to see things clearly close-up."

    "timestamp": "April 16th, 2024",
    "content": "Johnson & Johnson          shares dipped slightly today, even as first-quarter earnings came in ahead of the consensus forecast.Shares of JNJ fell 1% to $145.16 apiece by mid-day trading today. MassDevice’s MedTech 100 Index — which includes stocks of the world’s largest medical device companies — fell slightly.The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based medtech giant reported profits of $5.4 billion for the quarter. That equals $2.20 per share on sales of $21.4 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.J&J recorded a massive bottom-line gain from losses of $491 million this time a year ago. It posted a sales uptick of 2.3% as well.Adjusted to exclude one-time items, earnings per share came in at $2.71. That landed 7¢ ahead of expectations on Wall Street. Sales equaled projections as experts forecast $21.4 billion in revenue.Johnson & Johnson MedTech brought in $7.8 billion of that overall revenue, good for year-over-year growth of 4.5%. (Innovative Medicine saw nearly $13.6 billion in revenue, up 1.1%.)The company said electrophysiology products and Abiomed in its Cardiovascular unit drove medtech sales, along with wound closure products in the General Surgery business.“Johnson & Johnson’s solid first-quarter performance reflects our sharpened focus and the progress in our portfolio and pipeline,” said Joaquin Duato, J&J chair and CEO. “Our impact across the full spectrum of healthcare is unique in our industry, and the milestones achieved this quarter reinforce our position as an innovation powerhouse.”More growth on the way for J&J MedTechJ&J plans to enhance its medtech portfolio even more through its planned $13.1 billion acquisition of Shockwave Medical, a deal announced earlier this month. Company officials see the deal closing by midyear.“The acquisition of Shockwave, with its leading intravascular lithotripsy or IVL technology, will provide us with a unique opportunity to impact coronary artery and peripheral artery disease, two of the highest-growth, innovation-oriented segments within cardiovascular intervention,” J&J CFO Joseph Wolk said during the company’s earnings call with analysts today.Recent news for Johnson & Johnson MedTech also includes FDA submission for approval of its Varipulse pulsed field ablation system, which already has regulatory nods in Europe and Japan. In addition, the company has filed for a CE mark in the EU for its SmartTouch SF dual energy catheter, which can toggle between pulsed field and radiofrequency ablation to treat AFib.The company’s revenue outlook for 2024 rose slightly, with sales expected to range between $88.7 billion and $89.1 billion. That marks a small uptick from the previous projection for between $88.2 billion and $89 billion. However, the company narrowed its adjusted EPS guidance to between $10.57 and $10.72. It previously forecast between $10.55 and $10.75.J&J officials highlighted the money the company is steering toward R&D.“Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts in the pipeline that will drive meaningful near and long-term growth across both Innovative Medicine and MedTech,” Wolk said.The analysts’ take on Johnson & JohnsonBTIG analysts Ryan Zimmerman and Iseult McMahon said in a report that the company expects its MedTech procedure volumes to remain above pre-COVID levels. Notably, they say J&J remains on track to submit its Ottava surgical robot for FDA investigational device exemption (IDE) in the second half of this year.The company last offered an Ottava update last November, providing a potential timeline for the highly anticipated surgical robot.Zimmerman and McMahon also highlighted softer trauma growth for J&J’s orthopedic business, highlighting procedure dynamics and competitive pressure. They say they view the results as mixed for competitor Stryker, in particular.Within the company’s Spine business, the analysts say the J&J results suggest healthy procedure volumes despite competitive losses. They view that as a positive for both the company and its broader competition within the spine market. That includes, in particular, Medtronic, Globus Medical, Alphatec,, OrthoFix and Xtant Medical, among others.Mike Matson, senior research analyst at Needham & Co., was also positive about J&J MedTech: “We believe that the JNJ Med Tech business performance indicates overall Med Tech market growth should remain strong through 2024.”Editor-in-chief Chris Newmarker contributed to this report."

Politan, which controls about 9% of Irvine, California-based Masimo, encouraged Masimo to accept the nominations and avoid a costly proxy fight.But today, Masimo said Politan’s efforts to take control of the board and remove Kiani from it “run counter to stockholders’ best interests, as well as those of the hundreds of millions of patients who rely on Masimo’s innovations.”“While Mr. Koffey continues to suggest he desires an ‘independent’ board, it appears from his continued attacks and misleading claims, including in Politan’s recent press release, that what he really seeks is a Board that agrees with him,” Masimo said in a news release responding to Politan’s latest charges.Politan Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer Quentin Koffey [Photo courtesy of Politan Capital Management]Masimo and Politan also sparred over the potential spin off Masimo’s consumer business two years after its controversial acquisition of Sound United for $1 billion.“We have serious concerns that Mr. Kiani, without proper oversight, will seek to push through a spin-off with poor corporate governance and IP arrangements where assets are allocated in such a manner designed to maintain his control and influence of both separated companies,” Politan said.In its response, Masimo said Kiani “is committed to pursuing a separation that would result in two separate companies (consumer and healthcare) having the best chance at future success. The proposed separation would result in a full deconsolidation of the financial statements for the two businesses. The board, including with significant input from Mr. Koffey, is fully involved in evaluating the separation and will ultimately be responsible for approving it.”Masimo said the board will consider Politan’s nominations before offering its recommendations in Masimo’s annual proxy materials for investors ahead of the 2024 annual meeting.The exact date and location of Masimo’s 2024 annual meeting is not yet clear. Last year’s meeting was on June 26; the year before, it was held on May 26.Masimo is the world’s 52nd-largest medical device manufacturer, according to Medical Design & Outsourcing‘s 2023 Medtech Big 100 ranking by revenue."

    "content": "This app for the for Apple Vision Pro enables users to view immersive, interactive holograms of the human body captured through medical scans in their real-world environment. [Image courtesy of Siemens Healthineers]Siemens Healthineers announced that it launched an app for surgical planning and medical education on the Apple Vision Pro.The Cinematic Reality app enables users to view immersive, interactive holograms of the human body captured through real-world medical scans. Surgeons, medical students or patients could use this technology. Visualizing through the app could assist in surgical planning or medical education, as well as helping patients visualize procedures.Siemens Healthineers said it made the app available on the Apple App Store.“Cinematic Reality gives people the opportunity to immerse themselves in a world of photorealistic renderings of the human anatomy. Apple Vision Pro perfectly presents that three-dimensional experience, combined with great flexibility and standalone use. We see great potential for the technology for clinical as well as educational purposes,” said Christian Zapf, head of Digital and Automation at Siemens Healthineers.With Cinematic Reality, users can zoom into details of clinical images, enlarge content and rotate around a human body rendering. It provides two-dimensional reading tools like scrolling and allows clinical case visualization without the need for an additional computer.Siemens Healthineers said the app helps provide a more realistic way of visualizing organs or body parts. This makes it easier to explain clinical cases to patients, discuss clinical questions or educate students. Down the line, the company thinks it could assist in pre-operative planning and communication.The news from Siemens Healthineers comes weeks after Stryker announced a myMako app for Apple Vision Pro and iPhone to accompany its Mako surgical robotics systems. When used on Apple Vision Pro, myMako allows surgeons to visualize and review patients’ Mako surgical plans anytime, anywhere."

    "timestamp": "March 1st, 2024",
    "content": "Medtronic          announced today that it received FDA 510(k) clearance for its OsteoCool 2.0 bone tumor ablation system.The medtech giant designed OsteoCool 2.0 to treat painful bone metastases and benign bone tumors like osteoid osteoma. The minimally invasive procedure uses probes to deliver radiofrequency energy that heats and destroys tumors. Meanwhile, it circulates water to cool the probes in close proximity to the active tip to avoid excess heating.With an upgraded design, the OsteoCool radiofrequency ablation system offers a number of new advantages over the previous generation. Medtronic’s system enables the simultaneous use of four internally-cooled probes. This allows physicians to ablate two vertebral bodies at once, or create larger ablation zones in extra-spinal applications.According to a news release, it’s the most powerful bone tumor ablation system on the market, delivering 20W per channel. That comes in well ahead of the Stryker OptaBlate bone tumor ablation system (7.5W per channel), Medtronic claims. According to Medtronic, it also offers the widest selection of probe sizes in the U.S. market with four available options.Medtronic said OsteoCool remains the only bone tumor ablation platform with internally-cooled probes on the market. It delivers predictable ablations, reducing the risk of heating around the lesion site with proven pain relief.The company plans to kick off a limited market release of OsteoCool 2.0 immediately, with a broad U.S. rollout planned for later this year.“OsteoCool 2.0 is a welcome upgrade to our interventional portfolio and further cements our status as offering the most innovative and comprehensive pain management portfolio in the industry,” said David Carr, VP and GM of Pain Interventions within the Neuromodulation business at Medtronic."

    "content": "The Blueprint MR guidance. [Image courtesy of Stryker]Stryker          announced today that surgeons completed the first shoulder arthroplasty surgeries in Europe using its Blueprint guidance.Dr. Julien Berhouet (Tours Hospital, France) and Dr. Lionel Neyton (Centre Orthopédique Santy and Hôpital Privé Jean Mermoz, France) performed the cases. These cases follow the first surgeries using the mixed reality (MR) guidance in North America last month. Blueprint received CE mark at the end of 2023.Neyton said the system allows him to tailor shoulder joint replacements to the unique needs and anatomy of his patients.“It’s exciting to be one of the first two hospitals in Europe to use Stryker’s Mixed Reality Guidance System,” said Berhouet. “I am also pleased to be leading a pilot study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of this new technology, alongside three other centres in France.”Stryker designed its Blueprint MR guidance system to combine software with the Microsoft HoloLens 2 headset. It allows the surgeon to track the position and orientation of surgical instrumentation in the physical environment.Blueprint MR guidance uses 3D images and widgets to guide surgeons and their instruments. Displayed on the patient and in the surgeon’s line of sight, the images and widgets avoid disrupting the surgical workflow. The FDA cleared this system about a year ago.“This latest tool builds upon a decade of Blueprint’s presence in Europe, and we continue innovating to ensure the platform has the potential to further benefit surgeons and patients alike,” said Markus Ochs, VP and GM of Stryker’s European Trauma & Extremities division."

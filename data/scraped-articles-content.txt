    "content": "FacebookXLinkedInShareGlobus Medical has won FDA clearance for its new ExcelsiusFlex orthopedics robot stereotaxic surgery in knee procedures and an expanded indication for its ExcelsiusHub system.\nAudubon, Pennsylvania-based Globus Medical received the 510(k) clearance on June 14 for the robotic positioning system, which was designed to help surgeons position implant components and prepare bony anatomy during orthopedic procedures.\n“We are ramping up production and targeting commercial release in the fourth quarter,” a Globus spokesperson told MassDevice today.\n“We are excited to have received 510(k) clearance by the FDA for ExcelsiusFlex with Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) application,” the spokesperson said in a email. “This new robotic navigation platform joins the already best-in-class Excelsius Ecosystem, designed to offer surgeons enhanced control, resection accuracy, and procedural flexibility to Total Knee Arthroplasty.”\n“ExcelsiusFlex is indicated to assist the surgeon in primary total knee arthroplasty procedures for guided resections based on implant placement planning,” she continued. “Multiple workflows and unrestricted jig-less resections restores control of the saw and the procedure to the surgeon. Streamlined user software enable efficient procedures.”\nIn 2017, Globus Medical won FDA clearance for its Excelsius GPS robot-assisted surgery platform for spine. The company launched its Excelsius3D intraoperative, image-guided robotic navigation in 2022 for use with Excelsius GPS. Excelsius3D was designed for more accurate implant placement, less radiation exposure and shorter operative times.\nRelated: 10 surgical robotics companies you need to know\nGlobus Medical’s ExcelsiusFlex 510(k) summary\nGlobus Medical used Excelsius GPS as the primary 510(k) predicate for ExcelsiusFlex, listing four other predicates: Globus Medical’s ExcelsiusHub and AQrate Robotic Assistance System, Stryker’s Mako Total Knee Application, and the Johnson & Johnson Medtech DePuy Synthes Velys Robotic-Assisted Solution.\nGlobus Medical’s 510(k) summary describes ExcelsiusFlex as “a robotic positioning system with a computer controlled robotic arm, hardware and software that works in conjunction with ExcelsiusHub to enable real time surgical navigation and robotic guidance using patient tracking arrays and a positioning camera.”\n“The system assists the surgeon in implant placement planning and intraoperative tracking of patient anatomy by locating anatomical structures and stereotaxic positioning of surgical instruments relative to patient CT images or directly acquired anatomical structures,” the company continued in its filing. “The navigation and guidance system determines the registration or mapping between the virtual patient (points on the patient images) and the physical patient (corresponding points on the patient’s anatomy) or directly acquired anatomical structures. Once this registration is created, the software positions the robotic arm on a planned resection plane.”\nThe ExcelsiusFlex system includes end effectors and instruments for patient tracking, patient attachment and navigation.\nThe 510(k) clearance also expanded the previous indication for ExcelsiusHub to include  orthopedic device planning and identification through directly acquired anatomical structures.\nGlobus Medical makes knee reconstruction implants under the similar Gen-Flex/GenFlex2 names. Globus Medical’s 510(k) summary materials say ExcelsiusFlex is compatible with the GENflex2 and the Actify total knee system.\nThe Actify system is not yet listed on Globus Medical’s website, but the FDA gave it 510(k) clearance on June 20, classifying it as a cemented, semi-constrained, polymer/metal/polymer patellofemorotibial knee prosthesis.\nGlobus robotic procedure growth accelerates\nGlobus has said in recent months that the robot was on the way. In November, Globus President and CEO Dan Scavilla said the company planned to launch a knee robot in the first half of 2024.\n“With that comes, obviously, the cementless knee, which I think will be the major player there and that is well progressing on a good pace,” Scavilla said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript of the Q3 2023 earnings call. “I think 2024, we’ll start talking obviously more about the joints in total.”\nLast month, Scavilla said the company had filed for regulatory review of the robot.\n“We’re building inventory, getting ready to roll it out,” he said on the Q1 2024 earnings call, later describing the robot as “one of the most exciting things I think we’ll get out the door this year.”\n“The ortho robot coming out … will allow us to have more volume ramp-up of our implants of knees and hips,” Scavilla later continued. \nProcedures using Globus robots in Q1 grew 15% over the same quarter the year before, he said, pushing total robotic procedures past 71,000 since launch.\nGlobus also expects an augmented reality headset to win FDA approval in the latter half of this year. \n“That’s one where we need to get that filed and approved through,” Scavilla said in May. “We feel good about it. We’re ready to do it, but it’s in queue right now just to get through our processes.”\nGlobus is still working through its merger with NuVasive, laying off employees at the former NuVasive headquarters in San Diego earlier this year.\nThis post was originally published on June 21, 2024, and updated on June 25 with the FDA clearance of Globus Medical’s Actify knee system."

    "title": "Meril unveils Misso orthopedic surgical robot",
    "timestamp": "June 20th, 2024",
    "content": "FacebookXLinkedInShare[Image courtesy of Meril]Meril this week unveiled its Misso surgical robot for simplifying orthopedic procedures.\nThe India-based company announced on LinkedIn that it is developing a total knee surgical robot. It designed Misso to help surgeons with personalized pre-planning and precise cutting for joint replacement surgery.\nAccording to Meril, Misso has an optical tracking sensor, a six-axis articulated robotic arm and “superior” safety systems. The surgical robotic system helps physicians perform real-time gap checks and modify a surgical plan intraoperatively.\nVarious cutting options are available on the Misso, including full and partial cutting based on surgeon preference. Cutting guides are not required and the system can perform a tibial cut and a fully finished femur with all the cuts, including peg holes.\nMeril designed Misso with bone movement monitoring to ensure safety during procedures. If bone movement is observed, the resection process stops. The resection will continue with automatic recovery of the bone position. If the robotic system’s tools contact the patient or other object, the collaborative robot arm will immediately stop moving.\nMisso uses optical tracking-based navigation and robotic assistance to ensure accurate results in shaping and aligning artificial knee joint components. The company aims to improve post-operative outcomes, reduce complications, and promote faster patient recovery.\nMeril joins the growing surgical robotics market and looks to compete with orthopedic surgical robot developers like Stryker and Zimmer Biomet. Stryker launched its next-gen Mako Total Knee surgical robotics platform in March 2023 after initially launching the total-knee platform in 2017. In February, Zimmer Biomet’s Rosa surgical robotic platform is cleared for shoulder and hip replacement procedures. The FDA also cleared it for partial knee replacement in April 2021."

    "title": "The 10 largest orthopedic device companies in the world",
    "timestamp": "June 12th, 2024",
    "content": "FacebookXLinkedInShare[Adobe Stock image]\nOur list of the largest orthopedic device companies has changed a lot since last year.\nA change in methodology means there is a new company at the top of this year’s MassDevice and Medical Design & Outsourcing ranking of the world’s largest orthopedic device companies. But mergers and spinoffs also added to the list two orthopedic developers and manufacturers that weren’t ranked last year.\nFrom endoscopic devices to brain surgery tech to emergency defibrillators, Stryker is so much more than an orthopedic device company. Our editors decided it was time to break out the company’s Orthopaedics and Spine business going forward. The move means that we now consider Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s DePuy Synthes business the world’s largest orthopedic device company, but just by a hair.\nStryker could be back on the top next year. DePuy Synthes’ revenue growth accelerated to 4.4% in 2023, but Stryker’s ortho and spine business grew at an even faster rate of 10.5%.\nIn fact, many of the companies on the largest orthopedic device companies list saw revenue growth pick up in 2023 as the industry returned to pre-pandemic growth levels.\nStryker has especially enjoyed success on the popularity of its Mako surgical robotic systems for knee and hip surgeries. Last year, the Mako systems passed the 1 million procedure mark globally. Expect Mako’s growth to speed up even more, with shoulder and spine applications planned for later in 2024.\nMako’s success means that many of Stryker’s competitors have also become more active in robotic and digital surgery.\nJohnson & Johnson’s DePuy Synthes recently secured FDA clearance for the use of its Velys surgical robot platform in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. The FDA previously cleared Velys for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in early 2021.\nMeanwhile, Zimmer Biomet recently agreed to distribute Think Surgical’s TMINI miniature robotic system for TKA, a move that provides a handheld robotic option on top of ZB’s flagship Rosa surgical robotics portfolio.\nAnd Smith+Nephew now has its CorioGraph pre-operative planning and modeling services for its Cori system.\nIn addition to robotic surgery, consolidation left its mark on our largest orthopedic device companies list. NuVasive is now part of Globus Medical, and SeaSpine is part of Orthofix.\nMeanwhile, Alphatec’s 37% revenue growth in 2023 launched it ahead of ZimVie’s spine tech business, which ZimVie sold in April for $375 million to H.I.G. Capital. (The former ZimVie spine business is now called Highridge Medical.)\nHere are the world’s 10 largest orthopedic device companies, ranked by ortho business revenue pulled from their most recent annual reports:\n\n\n\n\nLARGEST ORTHOPEDIC DEVICE COMPANIES\nANNUAL REVENUE (% CHANGE)\nHEADQUARTERS OR SIGNIFICANT LOCATIONS\n\n\n1\nJohnson & Johnson (DePuy Synthes)\n$8.9B (+4.4%)\nLocations: Raynham, Massachusetts.; West Chester, Pennsylvania; Warsaw, Indiana; Palm Beach Gardens, Florida\n\n\n2\nStryker (Orthopaedics and Spine)\n$8.7B (+10.5%)\nHQ: Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\n\n3\nZimmer Biomet\n$7.4B (+6.5%)\nHQ: Warsaw, Indiana\n\n\n4\nMedtronic (Cranial & Spinal Technologies)\n$4.8B (+6.9%)\nLocations: Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Colorado\n\n\n5\nSmith+Nephew (Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine)\n$3.7B (+5.6%)\nHQ: London\n\n\n6\nEnovis\n$1.7B (+9.2%)\nHQ: Wilmington, Delaware\n\n\n7\nGlobus Medical (merged with NuVasive)\n $1.6B *\nHQ: Audubon, Pennsylvania\n\n\n8\nOrthofix (merged with SeaSpine)\n$747M (+6.9%)\nHQ: Lewisville, Texas\n\n\n9\nConmed (Orthopedic Surgery)\n $533M (+15.5%)\nHQ: Largo, Florida\n\n\n10\n Alphatec\n$482M (+37%)\nHQ: Carlsbad, California\n\n\n\n* Revenue growth is unclear in Globus Medical’s annual report.\nWatch out for more Medtech Big 100 data posting in the late summer on our sibling site Medical Design & Outsourcing.\nHere are our 2023 rankings of the largest orthopedic device companies and our 2022 rankings."

TMINI, which received FDA clearance in May 2023, features a wireless, robotic handpiece. It assists surgeons in performing total knee replacement.\nFollowing a CT-based three-dimensional surgical plan, the TMINI robotic handpiece automatically compensates for the surgeon’s hand movement to locate bone pins along precisely defined planes. Cutting guides are then connected to the bone pins for accurate bone resection.\nThe distribution agreement results in an exclusive offering, integrating Zimmer Biomet technology into a customized TMINI solution. Zimmer Biomet said in a news release that TMINI complements its flagship Rosa surgical robot portfolio with a handheld robotic option. Rosa, which recently expanded into shoulder replacement, has four applications, including the knee. The company says it enables accurate implant placement to a predetermined, CT-based, 3D surgical plan.\nDr. Nitin Goyal, Zimmer Biomet’s chief science, technology and innovation officer, says the deal makes the company the first to offer two complementary robotic systems for surgeons looking to incorporate robotic assistance while performing a knee replacement. The company plans to introduce the customized TMINI system in select U.S. markets in the second half of 2024.\n“TMINI addresses surgeon demand for an ergonomic, wireless, handheld robotic system and now, in addition to Rosa, underscores our dedication to empowering surgeons with more choices to make the right decision for each patient,” Goyal said. “Our strategic partnership with Think Surgical allows us to explore the value of a handheld platform to accelerate adoption of robotics in orthopedic surgery.\n“We believe the TMINI system’s design is particularly valuable and well-suited for knee procedures performed in ambulatory surgery centers and other out-patient settings.”\nThe analysts’ view on the deal between Zimmer Biomet and Think Surgical\nTruist analysts Richard Newitter, Samuel Brodovsky, Ravi Misra and Benjamin Goldstein shared their thoughts on the distribution agreement:\n“For [Zimmer Biomet], we view this as a complimentary solution that is consistent with the company’s strategy to grow into the rapidly expanding orthopedic ASC/outpatient site of care and enhance [Zimmer Biomet’s] competitive position within this portion of the market,” the analysts wrote.\nThey say company management singled out ASCs and outpatient orthopedic procedures as a key growth and focus area last month. According to the analysts, the deal with Think provides another user-friendly offering in its portfolio. It should allow the company to compete with ASC-focused physicians who may have eyes on Stryker’s Mako robotic system.\nCurrently, Think Surgical has 10 other implant partners working with TMINI. However, the analysts highlighted the customization aspect of Zimmer Biomet’s deal with Think.\n“Our thinking is that the TMINI/ZBH solution will be customized not only for ZBH’s implant portfolio (i.e. Persona), but may also integrate other aspects of ZBH’s growing digital ecosystem and workflows,” the analysts said.\nAccording to the Truist team, TMINI costs around $500,000. That lands at nearly half the cost of competitive robotic systems, although they note the possibility of a different business model for the Zimmer Biomet version.\nThe analysts say that, despite no disclosed financial terms, they wouldn’t be surprised if Think structured participation from recurring implant revenue in some way. They suspect a potential revenue/profit sharing agreement within the relationship between companies."

Both Dewey and Reinhardt will serve on Orthofix’s executive leadership team.\nDewey previously held corporate officer roles at multiple global publicly traded medical device companies. She most recently was chief communications and investor relations officer for Treace Medical Concepts.\n“We are excited to welcome Julie to the company,” Orthofix President and CEO Massimo Calafiore said in a news release. “She is deeply respected within the industry and brings with her vast knowledge of our markets, technologies, and growth strategies. Her appointment not only strengthens our executive leadership team, but it also further establishes our focus on expanding our outreach with investors and analysts as we continue to drive profitability and growth for our shareholders.”\nDewey has held numerous roles with varying responsibilities within the medical device industry. Prior to Treace, she was chief corporate communications and IR officer at Nevro and senior vice president and chief communications officer at Wright Medical, which was acquired by Stryker in 2020.\n“I am thrilled to join Orthofix in this new leadership role at such a transformational time in its growth trajectory,” said Dewey. “I look forward to working with Massimo and the rest of the Orthofix team to execute on the company’s growth strategy and deliver a best-in-class experience for the investment community and key stakeholders.”\nReinhardt’s appointment was previously announced on May 23. He was most recently the worldwide president of DePuy Synthes Spine. Reinhardt will be responsible for leading SeaSpine, Orthofix’s global spine and biologics business, which was created through a massive merger last year.\nDewey’s appointment marks the latest significant leadership move at the Lewisville, Texas-based company. Last fall, the company terminated a trio of executives with cause. Orthofix cut ties with CEO Keith Valentine, CFO John Bostjancic and chief legal officer Patrick Keran following an investigation.\nThe company then picked former LimaCorporate CEO Massimo Calafiore as its next CEO in November.

The new LifePak 35 system received U.S.-only FDA clearance via a premarket approval (PMA) supplement on April 12. It builds on the previous version, the now-15-year-old LifePak 15.\nLifePak 35, a connected solution, provides life-saving teams with crucial patient information. Stryker says it supports the needs of emergency responders while enhancing patient care.\nAccording to a news release, the new monitor/defibrillator offers a slim, light, ergonomic design. It also features a large, intuitive touchscreen that provides a customizable clinical experience. LifePak 35 allows trend monitoring to guide caregiver decisions with configurable events and connected capabilities for patient data.\nBTIG analysts Ryan Zimmerman and Iseult McMahon received early feedback from EMS and firefighters based on discussions online in April. They noted then that LifePak 35 carries a price point twice as high as the previous generation.\nThe analysts expected WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity and a weight reduction of about 2-3 pounds. Software enhancements should help aid in CPR administration, enhanced battery life and other communication features, too.\n“After more than 10 years of research, coupled with feedback from hundreds of our customers around the globe, we’re excited to offer first responders and essential healthcare professionals an innovative monitor/defibrillator in a familiar, trusted platform,” said Anne Mullally, VP and GM of Stryker’s Emergency Care business. “By enabling more efficient workflow and providing clinical advancements with LifePak 35, we are proud to support the challenges these providers face in our communities.”"

The acquisition is slated to strengthen Stryker’s offerings in the soft tissue fixation segment for ligament and tendon reconstruction.\nArtelon designed its technology to enhance biological and mechanical ligament and tendon reconstruction. It has been used in over 60,000 implantations worldwide, according to the company.\n“Artelon’s proven product portfolio and differentiated offerings will enhance our ability to innovate and serve our customers,” Tim Lanier, president of Stryker’s Trauma and Extremities division, said in a news release. “The addition of Artelon’s products to our already robust foot and ankle and sports medicine product portfolios will fuel our goal of establishing comprehensive offerings for customers in these segments. We share a common dedication to integrity, quality, and advancing the knowledge of healthcare providers to achieve the best clinical outcomes and rebuild patients’ lives.”\nThe financial details of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Stryker and Artelon will continue operating as separate entities and proceed with business as usual until the transaction closes.\nMore about Artelon’s technology\nThe FlexBand Twist, FlexBand Solo, FlexBand Multi, and FlexBand Fix systems give orthopedic surgeons complete sets of tools and implants in a single-use, sterile blister. Each system targets specific indications.\nTwist is the company’s first soft tissue fixation system. It has a twist-in anchor locking and a Mod cube for intraoperative adaptability. Artelon designed Twist as a non-inflammatory matrix that can be quickly integrated with regenerating connective tissue. The quick integration allows the FlexBand technology to share in tensile loading, protecting the healing construct and driving the mechanical stimulation required for tissue regeneration and remodeling. According to the company, the FlexBand matrix is replaced by “highly organized” type-1 collagen over 4-6 years.\nArtelon’s Solo is a procedure kit with tap-in fixation for single ligament augmentation. The company designed the kit to reinforce a connective tissue repair or reconstruction. It helps simplify the tensioning step by offering the ability to auto-tension reinforce, the company says.\nMulti is a comprehensive procedure kit with tap-in fixation for multiple ligament augmentation. It helps re-tension, reinforce and biologically restore multiple ligament structures with one system. It offers 24 cm of FlexBand technology for more complex reconstructions.\nFix is a scaled-down procedure kit with tap-in fixation for single ligament augmentation. It contains a 0.5 cm by 8 cm FlexBand and two anchors. According to Artelon, the smaller profile allows for a more streamlined system with “right-sized” instrumentation for augmenting soft tissues in the extremities.\nIn May 2023, Artelon raised $20 million in a Series B funding round for its joint instability treatment. The company planned to use the proceeds to fund commercial growth and clinical research while developing its proprietary Dynamic Matrix technology for musculoskeletal soft tissue reconstruction."

Restarting the Mako Arm software before the start of a case or after the occurrence of software error #3 also reduces the hazards and harms.\nThe company recommends that healthcare providers use the risk mitigation steps to prevent software error #3 or to clear software error #3 if it is generated by the Mako robotic system. It also requests that healthcare providers return customer response forms to acknowledge the mitigation.\nThe Mako system has been an important driver of Stryker’s growth in knee and hip replacement tech, with over 1 million procedures performed in more than 40 countries. Needham analysts recently upgraded their rating of SYK shares from “Neutral” to “Buy” ahead of the launch of Mako shoulder and spine applications expected this year."

Medtronic is now pursuing three indications for Hugo as it builds on momentum outside the U.S., with install bases growing across 25 countries and over 100 independent scientific publications globally.\n“[It’s] critical that we are now operating across multiple indications, so that as we come into the market, we can have a series of launches across each of those to capture larger and larger pieces of the market. And we’re seeing good execution, early execution inside of each of those studies as well,” Mike Marinaro, EVP of Medtronic’s Medical Surgical portfolio, said during the company’s Q4 earnings call today. (Overall, Medtronic officials spoke of durable revenue growth and accelerated earnings growth.)\nThe Enable Hernia Repair U.S. clinical trial began with a robotic-assisted bilateral inguinal hernia repair procedure at Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C., performed by Dr. Jacob Greenberg, the trial’s national principal investigator.\nThe clinical trial is a prospective, multicenter study evaluating the safety and performance of Hugo RAS in support of an FDA submission. Medtronic’s Expand URO clinical trial for urologic procedures is nearly completed.\n“Our team is committed to exploring new technologies to advance care for patients,” Greenberg said in a news release. “This clinical trial aims to evaluate a new robotic-assisted surgery system in offering a precise and minimally invasive option for this painful condition, which affects millions of Americans every year.”\nMedtronic also initiated a prospective clinical study for gynecologic procedures to support a planned submission to the FDA.\n“Medtronic is committed to providing safe and effective healthcare technology that helps clinicians advance patient care,” said Eric Vang, VP of clinical research and medical science in the Surgical business in the Medical Surgical portfolio at Medtronic. ” Hugo builds on that commitment as we combine the power and potential of people and technology to drive healthcare forward for all.”\nThe Hugo RAS system is not cleared or approved in all markets. In the U.S., the Hugo RAS system is an investigational device and not for sale.\nHugo looks to join one of the largest medtech markets\nAccording to Medtronic, robotic-assisted procedures could give patients fewer complications, shorter hospital stays and faster returns to normal activities.\nThrough collaboration with surgeons and hospitals, Medtronic designed Hugo RAS to expand access to minimally invasive care to more patients worldwide.\nHugo is a modular, multi-quadrant platform designed for various surgical procedures with wristed instruments, 3D visualization and surgical video capture options in Touch Surgery Enterprise.\nThe company first unveiled Hugo in September 2019, and investors were eager to see it. At the time, SVB Leerink analysts said Medtronic’s entry into the soft tissue robot-assisted surgery space represented a significant growth opportunity for Medtronic — as well as Intuitive Surgical, which presently dominates soft-tissue robotic surgery — because it represented an expanding market.\nSeveral medtech companies have also entered the surgical robotics market in recent years, looking to compete with Intuitive. Intuitive has held the top surgical robot position for more than two decades and shows no signs of slowing down—it even won FDA clearance for its next-generation da Vinci 5 mulitport surgical robotics system in March.\nIn the orthopedics space, Stryker has its Mako surgical robot for hip and knee replacements, and it plans to expand into shoulder and spine applications. Zimmer Biomet launched its own orthopedic surgical robot, ROSA, for total knee replacement.\nSurgical robotics for soft tissue applications and endoscopic procedures are also rising. In 2019, Johnson & Johnson MedTech acquired Auris Health and its surgical robot for bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Cases for CMR Surgical’s Versius robotic system span over 130 complex and benign procedure types as the British company expands outside the United States. Versius performs colectomies, hernia repairs, hysterectomies, sacrocolpopexies, and lobectomies across seven surgical specialties.\nMany other medtech companies, such as Moon Surgical, SS Innovations, Noah Medical, Corin Group, and others, are developing surgical robots. MassDevice is keeping up with news in the space in our Surgical Robotics Hub here."

They believe the company could come in ahead of revenue estimates and overcome any potential market slowdown.\nThe analysts also say that Stryker expects to increase its M&A activity — a strategy CEO Kevin Lobo outlined last year. Needham believes the deals could serve as positive catalysts.\n\n\n\n\n“We find SYK shares attractive considering its potential for double-digit organic revenue growth and upgrade our rating to Buy from Hold,” they wrote.\nNew product launches include updates to Mako, with Shoulder and Spine applications slated for this year. (Read about Stryker’s anticipated launches and other major 2024 launches across medtech HERE). The analysts also pointed to the company’s next-generation LifePak 35 monitor/defibrillator, which it debuted last month.\n“We see Mako Shoulder and Spine as growth drivers for these respective businesses,” the analysts said. “SYK has also indicated that its capital order backlog is strong, and we believe that this will provide a tailwind for MedSurg.”\nOn M&A, the analysts say Stryker completed more than 50 acquisitions over the past 10 years. While deal volume was smaller in recent years, management indicated that the company is ramping up M&A efforts with more deals likely in the next few years. The analysts noted peripheral vascular, neuromodulation, women’s health, urology and soft tissue robotics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We think that additional tuck-in deals are most likely and given its successful M&A track record, we expect deals to serve as positive catalysts,” the analysts said. “We view Stryker as one of the best positioned large-cap med tech companies.”"
